# Rescue device by using GPS and SMS

This is one of my classesâ€™s project. Although this is a project for a certain subject, my teacher let us do whatever we want as long as we using a communication method. Therefore this subject has no restrictions.

# My work
This is a team project, we have done it in 2 months.
Although my main part in this project is code, yet the most annoying problems are in electronics parts. So, I just kinda did both, code and electronics.

 
# Technology
Nothing fancy just
- 2G (SMS and Call)
- GPS
- I2C

# Challenge
- The first one is power - energy suplies. Because of that our second prototype has been burned down and we are ordering new part, so we do not have demo nor picture yet. (Don't worry, it has work, it was just burned down because we change battery).
- The second challenge is soldering components, we have most of its done, until the device for soldering too strong for SIM part, so it destroyed the SIM part.
- The third challenge is bad component. Our SIM IC firmware is fake, so we have to change it completely.
- The forth problem is GPS, it cannot recieve location when you in house.
- The fifth problem is that, this is the first time we make a complete device (not just code or simulation), our member have no experience, so that no one understand the best way to do it.
