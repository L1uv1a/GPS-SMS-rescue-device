# Rescue device by using GPS and SMS

This is one of my classesâ€™s project. Although this is a project for a certain subject, my teacher let us do whatever we want as long as we using a communication method. Therefore this subject has no restrictions.

# My work
This is a team project, we have done it in 2 months.
Although my main part in this project is code, yet the most annoying problems are in electronics parts. So, I just kinda did both, code and electronics.

 
# Technology
Nothing fancy just
- 2G (SMS and Call)
- GPS
- I2C

# Challenge
- The first one is power - energy suplies. Because of that our second prototype has been burned down and we are ordering new part, so we do not have demo nor picture yet
- The second challenge is soldering components
